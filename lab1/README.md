# Compiliation and running
To compile the `lab.cpp` file and create an executable named `lab`, run the following command in the terminal:

    g++ -o lab1 lab1.cpp

If there are no errors, a new executable file named `lab` will be created in the same directory. To launch the executable, run the following command:

    ./lab
This will execute the `lab` program and any output will be displayed in the terminal window.
